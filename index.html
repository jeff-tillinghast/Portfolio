      <h2 class="subtitle">About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm deeply passionate about helping people solving problems through technology. As a school technology leader, that's taken me everywhere from curriculum design and teacher coaching, to launching and maintaining 200+ user WordPress Multi-User sites, to writing custom APIs and teaching Robotics and Engineering. I'm a voracious lifelong learner, as evidenced by the skills I've built through my own learning and problem-solving: building my first web server to run an application I needed for the classroom, learning SQL in order to effectively mantain our mission-critical Student Information System, learning Computer Science and Electrical Engineering in order to teach Robotics, and studying DevOps in order to help people and organizations innovate effectively, efficiently, and reliably.</p>
      <p><ul>Here's what I bring:
        <li><span class="about-bold">High-level equity- and inclusion-focused collaboration.</span> I lead teams. I coach teamwork. I practice equity-focused leadership.</li>
        <li><span class="about-bold">Creative problem-solving.</span> I am a lifelong jazz musician. I teach design thinking. I engineer solutions.</li>
        <li><span class="about-bold">Dedication to my craft.</span> I am constantly learning and adding new skills to my toolbox. I program-manage in my sleep. I am always looking to reflect and improve my product and my process.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <blockquote>"Jeff is a rare find in the technology world. Candidates often have technical knowledge but not understand [our users]. Or, they would be great teachers who wanted to be technology directors, but they lacked the hardware, software and application knowledge. Jeff has all these skills and talents already. As I said he is a rare find!"</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Jeff is a lifelong learner who holds himself to high standards and [brings] deep subject knowledge, strategic thinking, effective management, collaboration,
and optimism."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Jeff is well-known as someone who can master nearly any technical problem at the school and have success in short order."
